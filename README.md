# Code-Quiz-Chall

In this repository, I am creating a code quiz.  

## Goal

I will be taking a code quiz,
When I click the start button,
a timer starts and I am presented with a question,
When I answer a questionm
I am presented with another question
When I answer a question incorrectly,
The time is substracted from the clock,
When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0,
the game is over,
When the game is over,
Then I can save my initials and score.

## Process

I am still working on it since I wanted to apply CSS on it.  Still clyrifing code.
